<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was designed to optimize packaging logistics transitioning from a
single box approach to a single product / products model, which is the best method to use when 
the logistic workflow requires handling multiple products for multiple orders.
<br />
<br />
The software uses Quickbook reports, that need to be downloaded locally, as data source. Future 
versions will include a direct Quickbooks API solution using the OAUTH 2.0 protocol.
